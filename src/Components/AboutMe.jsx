    <p>Upon discovering my love for technical challenges and problem solving, I dived deep into the world of Software Engineering.</p>
    <p>Enrolling in General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive bootcamp was only the very first step in my journey, and I can't wait to tackle and solve important issues in my new role.</p>
